# Klaudia

CLI agent that helps users with software engineering tasks.

## Build & Test

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install ./cmd/klaudia   # updates the `klaudia` on your PATH
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...             # compile check only — writes no binary
go test ./internal/...                   # unit tests
go test ./e2e/...                        # the binary against a scripted model
make check                               # every hermetic layer — what CI runs
```

Testing is layered (static, unit, hermetic, e2e, live); `docs/testing.md` says
what each layer is for and where a new test belongs. Unit tests must not read
the real `$HOME` — `make hermetic` runs them against a poisoned one.

`go build ./...` with multiple packages compiles and *discards* the results: it
is a build check, not an install. `go build ./cmd/klaudia` does write a binary,
but into the working directory, not onto `$PATH`. Running `klaudia` after either
one runs whatever was installed last — a two-month-old binary in one real case.
Use `go install` when you mean to try the change.

## Internal Package Layout

- **agent** - Main event loop, orchestration, and sub-agent spawning
- **api** - Provider abstraction: Anthropic client + OpenAI-compatible shim
- **tools** - Local tool implementations
- **browser** - Lazy headless-Chrome engine + web search
- **permission** - The three permission modes (a leaf package)
- **trust** - Zones, command/tool classification, session-scoped grants
- **session** - Transcripts, resume, persisted compaction summaries
- **compaction** - Context/history compression (micro + auto)
- **mcp** - Model Context Protocol client (2026-07-28) + form elicitation
- **subagent** - Sub-agent types: built-in, and markdown-defined (`.klaudia/agents`)
- **worktree** - Per-sub-agent git checkouts: seed, adopt, conflict reporting
- **skill** - Bundled skills (`skill/bundled/*.md`) + user-defined skills (`.klaudia/skills`)
- **hooks** - Lifecycle hooks: the four events, project-hook trust, execution
- **gitguard** - Keeps an autonomous run (the goal loop) from discarding or staging uncommitted work it does not own
- **memory** - Auto-memory store
- **doctor** - `/doctor` environment diagnostics
- **gitprobe** - Klaudia's own read-only git calls, guarded against repo config
- **streamjson** - Bidirectional stream-json frontend
- **acp** - Agent Client Protocol v1 agent (editor-driven sessions)
- **tui** - Terminal UI (Bubble Tea)
- **prompt** - Prompt construction
- **cli** - CLI entry point and wiring
- **native** - Pure-Go search / bash-parsing / PDF
- **textsafe** - Cleaning text from files and servers before the model sees it
- **sandbox** - Local / OS-confined / container Bash execution
- **schema** - Type/schema definitions
- **version** - Version info

`e2e/` (outside `internal/`) holds the end-to-end tests. `internal/fakeapi` is
the scripted Anthropic API they and the `internal/cli` tests share — test
support, imported by nothing in the product.

## Design record

`docs/ux-spec.md` is the authoritative record of the two terminal-UX specs and
where the implementation deliberately differs from them — read it before
"fixing" something that looks unimplemented. `docs/trust.md`, `docs/jobs.md`,
`docs/working-tree.md`, `docs/hooks.md` and `docs/acp.md` cover five subsystems
in detail; `docs/embedding.md` is the versioned stream-json contract, and
`docs/testing.md` covers the test layers.

Hooks are the one subsystem that executes a string from a config file, so
`docs/hooks.md` is where the reasoning for the trust prompt lives. A hook runs
*after* the host gate, never instead of it: anything that lets a config file
grant permission is a bug, not a feature request.

There are three frontends — TUI, stream-json, ACP — and one contract between
them: `agent.Turn`, applied by `Turn.Apply`. A new capability is a **field on
`Turn`**, not another parameter on a per-frontend `RunFunc`; the per-frontend
signatures are what let `AskUserQuestion` and `ExitPlanMode` sit dead over
stream-json for months, because a frontend that omitted a capability was
indistinguishable from one that did not want it. `docs/acp.md` records what the
ACP frontend declines (client-side writes, `terminal/*`, `session/delete`) and
why those are decisions rather than gaps.

## Rules

- Pure Go: builds must stay `CGO_ENABLED=0`-clean (no cgo, no system libs).
- Keep `charmbracelet/bubbles`, `bubbletea`, and `lipgloss` on the **v1** line.
  The TUI depends on textarea/renderer internals that v2 changes (v2
  `textarea.SetHeight` repositions the viewport; bubbletea v2 rewrites the inline
  renderer), which would break the input-wrap and last-column workarounds. A v2
  bump is a deliberate project, not a routine `go get -u` (see CHANGELOG).
- The retired JavaScript reference lives on the `js-reference` branch; consult it
  with `git checkout js-reference` (not present on this branch).

## Commits

`area: lowercase sentence` subject, then a body explaining the reasoning and
separating what was measured from what was assumed. Sign your work with:

```
Co-Authored-By: Klaudia <noreply@greenthread.ai>
```

Nothing enforces this — there is no `commit.template` and no hook, and the
author identity comes from the user's `~/.gitconfig` — so it lives here instead.
Earlier commits carry `noreply@anthropic.com` (Claude Code's default) or a model
name in place of `Klaudia`; both are history, not the convention. Use the same
trailer on patches sent upstream on the maintainer's behalf.
