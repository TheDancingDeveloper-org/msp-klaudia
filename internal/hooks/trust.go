// A hook from the project config is a command that arrived with the repository.
//
// Cloning a repo and starting Klaudia in it would otherwise be enough to run
// whatever its .klaudia/config.toml says, before the user has read a line of it.
// That is not a hypothetical attack shape — it is the same one that made
// editors stop sourcing project-local config, and the reason .vscode tasks and
// direnv both grew an approval step.
//
// So the user confirms a project's hooks once. The unit of approval is the whole
// set, identified by a fingerprint, for two reasons. A prompt has to show what
// is being agreed to, and "these four commands" is something a person can read
// where "hooks: yes" is not. And approving a set rather than a file means
// *editing* it comes back for confirmation: the dangerous case is not the repo
// that asks on day one, it is the repo that asks for something harmless and
// changes it in a later pull.
//
// What this does not do: nothing here inspects what a command *is*. An approved
// hook runs unconfined with the user's privileges, which is what makes the
// feature useful and what makes the confirmation load-bearing. The prompt is the
// security control; there is no second line of defence behind it.

// Store records which project hook sets the user has approved.
//
// The zero value reads and writes ~/.klaudia/hooks.json. Path is settable so
// tests do not have to move HOME, and so a future per-machine state directory
// has somewhere to plug in.
