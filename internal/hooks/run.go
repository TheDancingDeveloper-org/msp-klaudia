// would mean every existing script needs editing to run under Klaudia for no
// benefit to anyone. Fields Klaudia does not produce are simply absent.

// about the tool call; reporting that to the model as a refusal would have it

// should not need a translation layer. Neither is required — exit codes and
// plain stdout cover almost everything, and a hook that prints a shopping list
// is treated as having printed a shopping list.
