// Package hooks runs user-configured shell commands at fixed points in a turn.
//
// A hook is the escape hatch for everything Klaudia should not have an opinion
// about: run the project's formatter after a write, refuse edits to generated
// files, paste the current ticket into every prompt, print a desktop
// notification when a long run finishes. None of that belongs in the agent, and
// all of it is cheap to express as a command.
//
// # What a hook is not
//
// It is not a security boundary, and it must not be mistaken for one. The host
// gate (internal/agent/hostgate.go) decides whether a tool call may change this
// machine, and internal/sandbox is the only kernel-enforced answer. A PreToolUse
// hook sits *beside* the gate rather than inside it: it runs after the gate and
// the permission check have both allowed the call, so a hook can narrow what
// Klaudia will do but can never widen it. That ordering is the whole reason
// hooks are allowed to block at all — a config file that could grant permission
// would be a way to turn the gate off by writing a file.
//
// # The four events
//
// Deliberately few. Claude Code has grown past thirty lifecycle events, and the
// long tail of them exists to serve one workflow each; every one is a promise
// about when the loop will call out, which is a promise about the loop's shape.
// These four are the ones that cannot be expressed any other way:
//
//   - SessionStart    — before the first request. Adds context.
//   - UserPromptSubmit — a prompt is about to be sent. Adds context, or blocks.
//   - PreToolUse      — a tool call is about to run. Blocks.
//   - PostToolUse     — a tool call finished. Adds feedback to the result.
//
// Stop/SubagentStop — "the model thinks it is done, make it keep going" — are
// absent on purpose: a hook that can deny completion can hang a session, and
// nothing in a shell command knows better than the loop whether the work is
// finished.
