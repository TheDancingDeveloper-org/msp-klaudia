// MCP calls used to prompt every time, in every mode, no matter what else the
// session had established. The prompt was also close to unanswerable: "may
// mcp__gsol__godot_game_time run?" is not a question a user has the information
// to decide, and approving it bought one qualified name — a renamed server or
// the next tool on the same server started again from nothing.
//
// The host gate runs ahead of this and is not something the session can turn
// off, so there is no longer an "untrusting" case to ask about: a configured
// MCP server is trusted roughly as much as the shell, which is the same bet as
// running it at all.
