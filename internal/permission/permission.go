// Package permission records the user's stance for a session and applies it to
// tool calls.
//
// Almost everything this package used to decide is now decided by zone, before
// it is consulted: agent.HostGate classifies each tool call and stops changes
// to the machine Klaudia is running on. What is left is the stance itself —
// get on with it, look but do not touch, or check nothing.
//
// There are no allow/deny rules here any more. Per-command approval was the
// model the zone model replaced, and keeping a second, overlapping gate meant
// two things that could each permit a call and neither of which described the
// other. The rules were also a trap in practice: one in a config demoted the
// next session to a mode that asked about everything, so the answer offered to
// stop a prompt was the thing that guaranteed more of them.
//
// It is a leaf package (no project imports) so both the tools and agent
// packages can depend on it without import cycles.
