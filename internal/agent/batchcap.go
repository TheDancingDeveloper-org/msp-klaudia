// maxMessageOutput caps the combined text of one turn's tool results.
//
// The per-result cap is not enough on its own, and parallel dispatch is what
// makes that obvious: five calls that each stop just under the 30 KB budget are
// 150 KB in a single user message, and a turn is not limited to five. Twenty
// Greps, each individually well-behaved, is most of a 200K window in one
// message — and unlike a single gusher, nothing in the per-result path sees
// anything wrong.
//
// 200 KB is roughly 50K tokens, a quarter of the default window. It is chosen
// to be generous enough that an ordinary turn never reaches it: the cap exists
// for the pathological batch, and a cap that trims normal work would cost more
// than it saves.

// capMessage trims a turn's tool results so their combined text fits
// maxMessageOutput, and reports whether it changed anything.
//
// Shares are allotted by water-filling rather than evenly: results already
// under their share keep everything, and what they do not use is redistributed
// to the large ones. Trimming a 200-byte result to an equal share of a budget
// it was never going to exhaust would lose real content to no purpose, and the
// bytes that need removing are all in the few big results anyway.
//
// It runs after the per-call events have been emitted, so a local frontend
// still shows what each tool actually produced. Only the model-facing copy is
// trimmed, and the notice naming the spill file travels with it.
