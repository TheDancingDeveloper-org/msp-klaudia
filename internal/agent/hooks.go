// Hooks are wired in at four points and nowhere else. This file holds the three
// decisions shared by all of them, so each call site is a line rather than a
// policy.
//
// Where they sit relative to the gate is the important one. A PreToolUse hook
// runs *after* the host gate and the permission check have both allowed the
// call, which means a hook can stop something Klaudia was willing to do and can
// never permit something it was not. A config file that could grant permission
// would be a way to disable the gate by writing a file, and a project config
// is a file that arrives with a clone.

// fireHooks runs the hooks attached to an event and surfaces anything the user
// needs to know about them.
//
// Notices go to the user as notice events and never to the model. A hook that
// failed to start, a typo in the config, output too big to inject: these are the
// operator's to fix, and telling the model its environment is misconfigured only
// invites it to work around the misconfiguration.
