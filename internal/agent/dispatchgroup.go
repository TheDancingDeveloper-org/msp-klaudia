// maxConcurrentTools caps how many tool calls execute at once.

// Five, matching what the harnesses that do this have converged on. The number
// is a guess bounded by two real costs rather than a measurement: file
// descriptors and page cache are not the constraint, but the frontend is — a
// group that finishes together delivers its buffered events together, and a
// wide group turns the transcript into a wall. Raising it is a measurement, not
// an edit.

// Runs of adjacent concurrency-safe calls execute together; everything else
// runs one at a time, exactly as before. The adjacency requirement is the
// important part: a Read, an Edit and another Read must stay in that order,
// because the second Read's result depends on the Edit having happened. Only a
// contiguous run can be collapsed without reordering anything, so the groups
// are maximal runs and nothing is ever lifted past a call it follows.
//
// The win is latency on the shape that dominates a turn — three or four Reads,
// or a Glob and two Greps, issued together to orient. Serially those are the
// sum of their round trips; grouped they are the slowest one.

// serial without dispatch needing to know it is in a group.
