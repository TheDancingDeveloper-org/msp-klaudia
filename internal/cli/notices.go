// is the result and nothing else, because `klaudia -p` gets piped into things.
// But a notice is not a step in the work, it is a diagnostic the operator is
// the only person who can act on — a hook that failed to start, project hooks
// waiting on an approval nobody is there to give, an MCP server that could not
// be reloaded. Those were being emitted into a renderer that dropped them,
// which is indistinguishable from not reporting them.
//
// stderr rather than stdout, so the output contract is unchanged and a notice
// cannot land in the middle of a stream-json line.
