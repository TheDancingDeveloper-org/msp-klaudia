# Context Compaction

How Klaudia keeps a conversation within the model's context window.
Implemented in `internal/compaction` and driven from `internal/agent/loop.go`.

## Two stages, every turn

At the top of each agent turn:

1. **Microcompact** — fast, local, no model call. Elides old tool results when
   they dominate the context.
2. **Autocompact** — model-based summarization, only when nearing the window
   limit. Replaces the history with a summary.

Both can be disabled by env var (matching the JS reference):

```bash
DISABLE_COMPACT=1        # disable both stages
DISABLE_MICROCOMPACT=1   # disable only microcompact
DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=1   # disable only autocompact
```

Token counts are estimates (~4 chars/token for text, a flat per-item estimate
for images/documents) — close enough to drive the thresholds without a real
tokenizer. See `EstimateTokens` in `internal/compaction`.

## Microcompact

Drops the content of tool results older than the most recent few when they
dominate the context, replacing each with a short placeholder. It only acts when
the saving is worthwhile, so it's cheap and rarely disruptive.

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KeepLastNResults` | 3 | Recent tool results left untouched |
| `ToolResultTokenThreshold` | 40000 | Act only when tool-result tokens exceed this |
| `MinTokensToSave` | 20000 | Minimum saving before eliding |
| `EstimatedTokensPerImage` | 2000 | Flat estimate per image/document |
| `elidedPreviewBytes` | 120 | How much of the original survives in the placeholder |

### The placeholder is a handle

An elided result is not simply deleted. The placeholder names the original's
size, quotes its first non-empty line, and points at a spill file holding the
full text:

```
[Old tool result elided to save context; 70 bytes; began: ./internal/agent/loop.go:349: for _, tu := range toolUses {; full text: /…/outputs/elided-123.log]
```

Without that, a pass left several byte-identical markers and the model had no
way to tell which call each had been, nor to get any of them back short of
re-running the tool. The preview and path cost a few dozen tokens against the
thousands a pass reclaims, and recovery is an ordinary `Read`.

The spill is supplied by the caller as a `Spiller` func, not imported, so this
package keeps no dependency on `internal/tools`; the agent loop passes the same
on-disk spill the per-result cap uses. A nil `Spiller` is valid and the
placeholder then promises no file.

`Microcompact` therefore runs two passes. `compact()` is called at the top of
every turn, so the first pass prices the placeholders *without* paths and
checks `MinTokensToSave`, letting the floor reject the pass before anything is
written — a single pass would write a fresh set of spill files on every turn a
conversation spent sitting just under that floor. The second pass spills and
recomputes the exact saving with the real paths in place.


## Autocompact

When the estimated token count exceeds the compaction threshold, Klaudia asks
the model to summarize the conversation and replaces the history with that
summary. Thresholds (`ComputeThresholds`):

```
reserve          = min(20000, contextWindow)         // halved for tiny windows
effectiveWindow  = contextWindow - reserve
compactThreshold = effectiveWindow - 13000           // autocompact triggers above this
blockingLimit    = effectiveWindow - 3000            // hard ceiling
```

`DefaultContextWindow` (200000) is assumed when the model's window is unknown.

## Before either stage: the per-result cap

Compaction deals with history that has already accumulated. The cheaper defence
is not letting a single tool result become enormous in the first place, and that
happens at dispatch time in `internal/tools/output.go`.

Two levels, deliberately:

1. **Tool-level, smart.** A tool that understands its own output clamps it
   itself. Bash is the only one today: it keeps a head *and* a tail, because the
   verdict (`FAIL`, the error that stopped the build, the last stack frame) is at
   the end, and it appends the exit-code annotation after clamping so that
   survives too.
2. **Loop-level, dumb, universal.** `tools.Cap` is the backstop the agent loop
   applies to whatever a tool returned. It is byte-level and content-blind — the
   weaker of the two — but it is the only one that covers tools nobody tuned,
   including every MCP tool.

Both clamp to `maxToolOutput` (30000 bytes, head-heavy at 20000/10000) and write
the untruncated text to `~/.klaudia/outputs/<tool>-*.log`, appending a
`[full output: <path>]` notice so the model can read the elided middle. Files
older than 24h are pruned on each spill. Output already within budget is
returned unchanged, so the backstop never re-cuts a self-clamped result.

The UI never sees a truncated result: `tools.Result.Full` carries the complete
text in memory for local display, separately from what the model receives.

### And the per-message cap, after it

A per-result cap cannot see a batch. Five results that each stop just under
30 KB are 150 KB in one user message, and a turn is not limited to five calls:
twenty well-behaved `Grep`s is most of a 200K window, with nothing in the
per-result path finding anything wrong. Parallel dispatch makes that shape
common rather than theoretical.

`capMessage` (`internal/agent/batchcap.go`) holds one turn's combined
tool-result text to `maxMessageOutput` (200000 bytes, ~50K tokens). Shares are
allotted by water-filling, not an equal split: a result already under its share
keeps every byte and the remainder goes to the ones that need it, because
trimming a 200-byte result to an equal share of a budget it was never going to
exhaust loses content to no purpose and frees nothing that matters.

Two things it leaves alone. Image parts, which the model cannot recover from a
log file. And the spill notice of a result the per-result cap already wrote: the
tail keeps that path, and a second spill would only preserve the already-clamped
copy. It runs after each call's events are emitted, so a local frontend still
shows what the tool produced.

### Divergence: persisted summaries

Beyond the JS scheme, each autocompact summary is offered to the CLI via
`agent.Options.OnSummary` and written alongside the transcript in
`~/.klaudia/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.summary.md`. On resume, Klaudia seeds the
conversation from that summary instead of replaying the whole transcript
(token-saving); `--full` forces a full replay. See `internal/session/summary.go`.
