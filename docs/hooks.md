# Lifecycle hooks

A hook is a shell command Klaudia runs at a fixed point in a turn. It is the
escape hatch for everything the agent should not have an opinion about: run the
project's formatter after a write, refuse edits to generated files, paste the
current ticket into every prompt, notify you when a long run finishes.

```toml
# .klaudia/config.toml — or ~/.klaudia/config.toml

[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
matcher = "Edit|Write"
command = "gofmt -w $(jq -r '.tool_input.file_path') 2>/dev/null"

[[hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Edit|Write"
command = '''
case "$(jq -r .tool_input.file_path)" in
  *.pb.go|*_generated.go) echo "generated file — edit the source" >&2; exit 2 ;;
esac
'''

[[hooks]]
event = "UserPromptSubmit"
command = "echo \"Branch: $(git branch --show-current)\""
timeout = "5s"
```

## What a hook is not

**A hook is not a security boundary, and must not be used as one.** The host
gate (see [trust.md](trust.md)) decides whether a tool call may change this
machine; `internal/sandbox` is the only kernel-enforced answer.

A `PreToolUse` hook runs *after* the gate and the permission check have both
allowed the call. So a hook can narrow what Klaudia will do and can never widen
it. That ordering is the entire reason hooks are allowed to block at all: a
config file that could *grant* permission would be a way to switch the host gate
off by writing a file.

## The four events

Deliberately few. Claude Code has grown past thirty lifecycle events; each one
is a promise about when the loop will call out, which is a promise about the
loop's shape. These four cannot be expressed any other way.

| Event | When | Can add context | Can block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | once, before the first request | yes | no |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | a prompt is about to be sent | yes | yes |
| `PreToolUse` | a tool call is about to run | no | yes |
| `PostToolUse` | a tool call finished | yes (as feedback on the result) | fails the call |

`SessionStart` cannot block because there is nothing to block — the session is
already starting, you asked for it, and the only honest response to "your
`SessionStart` hook said no" is to say so and carry on.

`Stop`/`SubagentStop` — "the model thinks it is done, make it keep going" — are
absent on purpose. A hook that can deny completion can hang a session, and
nothing in a shell command knows better than the loop whether the work is done.

`SessionStart` fires once per *session*, not once per turn, and not again when a
sub-agent starts. Sub-agents run the two tool events and skip
`UserPromptSubmit`: their prompt is the parent's instruction, not yours.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event` | one of the four above. A typo is reported, not silently ignored. |
| `matcher` | regexp matched against the tool name. Only meaningful for the two tool events; omit to match every tool. |
| `command` | run through the same shell as the Bash tool (`bash -c`, or `sh -c` where bash is absent), in the project directory. |
| `timeout` | Go duration (`"5s"`, `"2m"`). Defaults to 30s. |

Hooks run **one at a time, in declaration order**, yours before the project's.
They are allowed to have side effects on the working tree — formatting a file is
the motivating case — and two of them writing the same file at once is a
corruption you cannot debug from inside Klaudia. The first block stops the
sequence.

The 30-second default is half Claude Code's minute. A `PreToolUse` hook is in
the critical path of *every* tool call, so a hook that hangs is a session that
looks frozen, and the formatter and linter cases finish in well under a second.
A hook that genuinely needs longer can say so; the default protects the person
who did not think about it.

## What a hook is told

A JSON object on stdin. The field names are Claude Code's, because hook scripts
are the most portable artefact in the ecosystem — a few lines of shell reading
`jq -r .tool_input.file_path` — and a gratuitously different payload would mean
editing every existing script for no benefit. Fields Klaudia does not produce
are absent.

```json
{
  "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
  "session_id": "…",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "tool_name": "Edit",
  "tool_input": { "file_path": "…", "old_string": "…" },
  "tool_response": "the tool's output",
  "tool_error": false,
  "prompt": "the text about to be sent (UserPromptSubmit)"
}
```

`tool_input` is the arguments the model produced, verbatim. Two environment
variables are also set: `KLAUDIA_PROJECT_DIR` and `KLAUDIA_HOOK_EVENT`.

## What a hook says back

**Exit status** covers almost everything:

- **0** — fine. Anything on stdout becomes context (see below).
- **2** — block it. stderr is the reason, and it is shown to the model.
- **anything else** — the hook malfunctioned. Reported to *you*; the model is
  never told.

That last distinction is the point of using 2 specifically. A hook that exits
127 because the formatter is not installed has not made a judgement about the
tool call, and reporting it to the model as a refusal would have it reason
about — and route around — a broken environment. A timeout is a malfunction, not
a refusal, for the same reason.

**stdout** is injected into the conversation: `SessionStart` and
`UserPromptSubmit` output is prepended to the prompt in a `<hook-context>`
block; `PostToolUse` output is appended to the tool's result, labelled, so the
model can see it is feedback rather than the tool's own words. It is capped at
8 KB, because hook stdout is prompt: `command = "git log"` in a long-lived repo
is megabytes in front of every message. Truncation is reported to you.

A hook may instead print JSON to be explicit:

```json
{ "decision": "block", "reason": "generated file", "additionalContext": "…" }
```

Claude Code's nested `hookSpecificOutput` shape is also accepted. Neither is
required: a hook that prints a shopping list is treated as having printed a
shopping list.

## Hooks that arrive with a repository

Cloning a repo and starting Klaudia in it would otherwise be enough to run
whatever its `.klaudia/config.toml` says, before you have read a line of it.
That is the attack shape that made editors stop sourcing project-local config,
and the reason `.vscode` tasks and `direnv` both grew an approval step.

So:

- Hooks in `~/.klaudia/config.toml` are **yours** and run unconditionally.
  Asking you to confirm your own settings file is the kind of prompt that
  teaches people to stop reading prompts.
- Hooks in the project's `.klaudia/config.toml` are **confirmed once**. You are
  shown every command and the file it came from, and the answer is recorded in
  `~/.klaudia/hooks.json`, keyed by project directory.
- The unit of approval is the whole **set**, identified by a fingerprint over
  each hook's event, matcher, command and timeout, in order. Editing the set
  comes back for confirmation — the dangerous case is not the repo that asks on
  day one, it is the repo that asks for something harmless and changes it in a
  later pull. Reverting to a previously-approved set re-asks too, since that is
  precisely the move available to an attacker who was approved once.
- Nothing inspects what a command *is*. An approved hook runs unconfined with
  your privileges, which is what makes the feature useful and what makes the
  confirmation load-bearing. The prompt is the control; there is no second line
  of defence behind it.

In a headless run there is nobody to ask, so project hooks do not run and a
notice says so. "Nobody objected" is not agreement.

Hooks are not sandboxed, whatever `[sandbox]` says. That setting confines the
*model's* commands; a hook is your own automation, and the things it exists to
do — run a formatter, touch a git index, post a notification — are exactly what
confinement forbids.

## Seeing what is configured

`/doctor` lists every hook by event and matcher in the order they will run,
counts them by scope, and warns when a project set is configured but still
waiting on your approval — the state whose only symptom is otherwise silence.
Config problems (an unknown event, a bad regexp, a matcher on an event that has
no tool to match) are reported as notices on the first turn; the bad entry is
dropped and the rest still run.

Hook notices go to you and never to the model. A misbehaving hook is the
operator's problem to fix, and telling the model about it only invites it to
work around a broken script.

Implementation: `internal/hooks` (events, trust, execution) and
`internal/agent/hooks.go` (the four call sites in the loop).
